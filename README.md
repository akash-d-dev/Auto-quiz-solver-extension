## ❓ **FAQs**

### 🔹 **What is Auto Start?**
- **Yes**: The quiz starts automatically whenever you open a module page with a quiz.
  - Useful for solving multiple quizzes at once.
- **No**: You need to manually click on **"Mark as Done"** on the module page to start solving the quiz.

### 🔹 **What is Delay?**
- Delay is the time the extension waits before scanning the page for the **"Mark as Done"** button.
- Adjust the delay based on your internet speed:
  - **Increase** if your internet is slow.
  - **Decrease** if your internet is fast.

### 🔹 **What is Token?**
- You can provide your **own Kalvium access token** (usually from another email) to increase anonymity.
- However, this feature is **no longer useful** as every user now gets different quiz questions.

### 🔹 **How to Prevent the Quiz from Opening in Fullscreen?**
- We are **exploiting a bug** to prevent full-page mode:
  1. Turn on **Auto Start**.
  2. Open the **module page(s)** in a new tab.
  3. Wait until the quiz page for that module is opened.
  4. When you open your quiz page, it will not go fullscreen.
  - (*Recommended wait time: Delay + 5-10 seconds*)

### 🔹 **What Do Different Page Background Colors Indicate?**
- 🟡 **Yellow**: The extension is retrieving answers from the backend (loading indicator).
- 🔴 **Red**: Failed to fetch answers.
- 🟢 **Green**: Answers have been fetched and now the extension has started solving the quiz.

### 🔹 **How to Reset or Change API Keys?**
1. Open **kalvium.community**.
2. Go to **LocalStorage**.
3. Modify or reset your API keys from there.

### 🔹 **Why Did the Extension Fail to Solve the Quiz?**
A failure can happen due to:
- Invalid or expired **API keys** (Check if your API key has reached its limit or is incorrect).
- Wrong or expired **access token**.
- Other API-related issues (Check logs for more details).
